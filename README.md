# Facebook-Ad-Bidding-Strategies
Comparing two different Facebook Bidding strategies

Explanation ------------
These visualizations show how companies can use two different strategies of Facebook bidding to get maximum profit. Facebook bidding is where a company creates an ad and spends a certain amount of money to make sure the ad shows up on people's screens. The general consensus is that the more money you spend, the more people whose screens have the ad on them. However, in reality, this visualization shows two different strategies where you find that there are different ways to spend that money for your needs. One strategy is the average spending strategy. This means that the company will spend an average dollar amount per impression, for example, they could say "I want to spend on average $1.00 per impression" (In reality this number is much much lower). The other strategy is when the company says that they have a maximum spending per impression, so they would say "I want to spend a maximum of $2.00 per impression." 


Average Bidding Strategy

+ Company spends an average dollar amount per impression
+ Better for smaller companies
+ Can spend as little or as much as you want
+ Can limit dollar amounts for impressions

Maximum Bidding Strategy

+ Company spends a maximum dollar amount per impression
+ Better for high-dollar, top-tier companies
+ Can turn into more profit (likely spends the extra money to find more suitable customers)
+ Must spend higher amounts


Conlcusion ------------


Using the final graph where you compare both the lines side by side, you can find that the maximum strategy works better for higher companies that make much more money, while something like the average strategy can work much better for smaller, more local companies that don't want to spend a lot. The graphs compare the earnings to the impression, showing that the maximum can make you more money (likely because it finds more suitable clients using the extra money), but you have to spend more to even have it work since the maximum graph does not even start until you spend a certain amount.
